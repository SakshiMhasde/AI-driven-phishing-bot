# AI-Driven-Phishing-Bot
## Understanding the Problem Statement

You need to develop an AI-driven phishing bot that can conduct phishing campaigns. This involves several stages:

1.  Reconnaissance: Collect email addresses from a target domain.

2.  Profiling: Gather detailed information about those email addresses.

3.  Phishing Email Generation: Use AI to create realistic phishing emails.

4.  Communication with Bots: Test the phishing emails on AI-driven bots and track success.

## Part 1: Reconnaissance

Objective: Create a dashboard to manage phishing campaigns and gather email addresses from a target domain.

#### Steps to Implement:

1.  Dashboard Setup:

-   Create a web application with user login functionality. This can be done using frameworks like Flask (Python), Django (Python), or even a frontend framework like React with a backend server.

-   Set up a database to store campaigns and email addresses. Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

3.  Campaign Management:

-   Create a user interface to create new campaigns and view existing ones.

-   Allow users to input a target domain name for the campaign.

5.  Email Collection:

-   Automated Collection: Write scripts to scrape email addresses from the web. Tools like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy in Python are useful for web scraping.

-   Example tools and techniques: Google Dorking, Hunter.io API.

-   Email Verification: Use APIs (e.g., NeverBounce, ZeroBounce) to verify active email addresses.

-   CSV Upload: Allow users to upload a CSV file with email addresses. Process this file to filter and store unique email addresses.

#### Deliverables:

-   A report on the tools and methods used for reconnaissance.

-   A list of active email addresses collected and verified.

## Part 2: Profiling

Objective: Create detailed profiles for each collected email address.

#### Steps to Implement:

1.  Define Profiling Parameters:

-   Identify parameters to collect (e.g., name, job title, social media profiles, interests).

3.  Automated Profiling:

-   Use APIs and scraping tools to gather data. For example, use LinkedIn API, Facebook Graph API, or general web scraping.

-   Store this data in your database.

5.  Manual Profiling:

-   Allow users to manually input or correct data. Provide an interface where users can upload an Excel sheet or directly edit profiles.

#### Deliverables:

-   A report on tools and methods used for profiling.

-   Detailed profiles for each active email address.

## Part 3: AI-Driven Phishing Email Generation

Objective: Develop an AI model to generate and send phishing emails that appear legitimate.

#### Steps to Implement:

1.  Training the Model:

-   Collect a dataset of spam and legitimate emails.

-   Use this dataset to train a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to generate realistic phishing emails.

-   Fine-tune the model to understand and replicate legitimate email patterns.

3.  Phishing Email Creation:

-   Generate emails tailored to the profiles created in Part 2. The content should be convincing and contain phishing links or attachments.

-   Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to ensure the emails appear legitimate.

5.  Phishing Campaign Execution:

-   Develop a bot to send the phishing emails to the collected email addresses.

-   Use email-sending libraries like smtplib in Python or email services like SendGrid.

#### Deliverables:

-   A report on the AI model training process and the dataset used.

-   Samples of generated phishing emails.

-   A report on the phishing campaign's performance metrics.

## Part 4: AI-Driven Bot Communication & Validation

Objective: Develop AI bots to mimic real users and validate the success of phishing attempts.

#### Steps to Implement:

1.  Bot Persona Creation:

-   Create AI personas based on the profiled data from Part 2.

-   Train models to mimic real user behavior, including language style and response patterns.

3.  Phishing Attempt Communication & Validation:

-   Send phishing emails to these AI personas.

-   Evaluate their responses to determine if the phishing attempt was successful.

-   If the attempt fails, adjust the email content and try again.

#### Deliverables:

-   A report on AI model training for bot personas.

-   Samples of bot responses.

-   A report on the phishing campaign success metrics.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Start

1.  Set Up Your Environment:

-   Install Python and necessary libraries.

-   Set up a web framework (Flask or Django).

3.  Create the Dashboard:

-   Implement user login and authentication.

-   Create views for managing campaigns.

-   Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL).

5.  Develop Reconnaissance Tools:

-   Write web scraping scripts using BeautifulSoup and Scrapy.

-   Integrate Hunter.io API for email collection.

-   Implement email verification using APIs like NeverBounce.

7.  Build Profiling System:

-   Define profiling parameters.

-   Develop scripts to gather data from various sources.

-   Create a user interface for manual profiling.

9.  Train AI Model for Phishing Emails:

-   Collect and preprocess a dataset of emails.

-   Train a language model (e.g., GPT-4) using this dataset.

-   Generate sample phishing emails.

11. Execute Phishing Campaigns:

-   Develop a bot to send emails.

-   Track open rates, click rates, and other metrics.

13. Create and Test AI Personas:

-   Develop AI-driven bots to mimic real users.

-   Send phishing emails to these bots and analyze responses.

-   Iterate and improve email content based on bot feedback.
